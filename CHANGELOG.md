## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Wait-ForIdleLcm`
  - Added new parameter `Timeout` to be able to return after the specified
    elapsed time ([issue #101](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResource.Test/issues/101)).

### Changed

- DscResource.Test
  - Rename the default branch to `main` ([issue #104](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResource.Test/issues/104)).
  - Updated pipeline files, using the latest Sampler deploy tasks.
- `Wait-ForIdleLcm`
  - Updated to wait as long as the `LCMState` property has the state `'Busy'` ([issue #101](https://github.com/dsccommunity/DscResource.Test/issues/101)).
    This will prevent the pipeline to loop indefinitely when an integration
    test fails and the property `LCMState` is set to `PendingConfiguration`.

### Fixed

- `Invoke_HQRM_Tests`
  - Fixed the task so it runs together with latest PowerShell module Sampler.
- `Fail_Build_If_HQRM_Tests_Failed`
  - Fixed the task so it runs together with latest PowerShell module Sampler.

## [0.15.0] - 2021-02-09

### Added

- Added test helper functions `Get-InvalidResultRecord` and `Get-InvalidOperationRecord`.
- Added alias `Get-ObjectNotFoundRecord` that points to `Get-InvalidResultRecord`.
- Added build task `Invoke_HQRM_Tests` and `Fail_Build_If_HQRM_Tests_Failed`.
- Added meta build task `Invoke_HQRM_Tests_Stop_On_Fail` that runs both
  build tasks `Invoke_HQRM_Tests` and `Fail_Build_If_HQRM_Tests_Failed`
  in correct order.
- New QA (HQRM) tests for Pester 5 was added that will only run if Pester 5.1
  is used by the test pipeline.
- Added (converted) HQRM test for Pester 5
  - Added `Changelog.common.v5.Tests.ps1`
  - Added `ExampleFiles.common.v5.Tests.ps1`
  - Added `FileFormatting.common.v5.Tests.ps1`
    - The individual test for checking BOM on markdown files was remove
      and replaced by a test that checks for BOM on all text files (code,
      configuration, and markdown). That also replaced the Pester 4 tests
      `ModuleFiles.common.v4.Tests.ps1` (that only checked for BOM on
      `.psm1`files), and `ScriptFiles.common.v4.Tests.ps1` (that only
      checked for BOM on `.ps1` files). No changes were made to the
      Pester 4 tests, just the Pester 5 tests.
  - Added `MarkdownLinks.common.v5.Tests.ps1`
  - Added `ModuleManifest.common.v5.Tests.ps1`
  - Added `ModuleScriptFiles.common.v5.Tests.ps1`
    - Contain the converted Pester 4 tests from `Psm1Parsing.common.v4.Tests.ps1`.
  - Added `PSSAResource.common.v5.Tests.ps1`
    - Any test that is excluded by using Pester `ExcludeTag` under the key
      `DscTest:` will now be silently excluded due to how Pester does _Discovery_.
  - Added `PublishExampleFiles.v5.Tests.ps1`
  - Added `ResourceSchema.common.v5.Tests.ps1`
- Added public function `Get-DscResourceTestContainer` which returns a Pester
  container for each available Pester 5 HQRM test.

### Changed

- Renamed all existing QA (HQRM) tests to `*.v4.Tests.ps1*` and made
  them not run if test pipeline is using Pester 5.
- The function `Get-TextFilesList` can now take an optional parameter
  `FileExtension` to only return those files, e.g. `@('.psm1')`. This
  makes the function `Get-Psm1FileList` obsolete.
- `Get-DscResourceTestContainer`
  - Changed to support the new Pester 5 HQRM tests, and code for an older
    Pester 5 Beta iteration was removed.
- Added a `build.yaml` task script `Add_Aliases_To_Module_Manifest` that
  update module manifest with a list of aliases that is configured in
  the `build.yaml` file under the key `AliasesToExport:`. This is quick
  fix for the issue [Export alias create with Set-Alias and New-Alias](https://github.com/PoshCode/ModuleBuilder/issues/103).
